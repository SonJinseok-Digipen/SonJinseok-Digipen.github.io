Some features and functionality in curl and libcurl are considered {\bfseries{EXPERIMENTAL}}.

Experimental support in curl means\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Experimental features are provided to allow users to try them out and provide feedback on functionality and API etc before they ship and get \char`\"{}carved in stone\char`\"{}.
\item You must enable the feature when invoking configure as otherwise curl will not be built with the feature present.
\item We strongly advice against using this feature in production.
\item {\bfseries{We reserve the right to change behavior}} of the feature without sticking to our API/\+ABI rules as we do for regular features, as long as it is marked experimental.
\item Experimental features are clearly marked so in documentation. Beware.
