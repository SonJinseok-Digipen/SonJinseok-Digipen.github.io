Before you submit an issue\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Search in the current \href{https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues}{\texttt{ list of issues}}, \href{https://community.aseprite.org/c/bugs}{\texttt{ bug reports}}, or \href{https://community.aseprite.org/c/features}{\texttt{ feature requests}}.
\item If the issue already exists, add a \+:+1\+: or a \+:heart\+:, and you can click the {\ttfamily Subscribe} or {\ttfamily Watching} button to get notifications via email.

Before you submit an issue or a post about a {\bfseries{compilation problem}}, check the following items\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item See how to get the source code correctly in the \mbox{\hyperlink{md__ase_sprite_aseprite__i_n_s_t_a_l_l}{INSTALL}} guide.
\item Check if you are using the latest repository clone.
\item Remember that we use submodules, so you need to initialize and update them.
\item Remember that might be some \href{https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/pulls}{\texttt{ pull requests}} being reviewed to fix your same problem.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you have a compilation problem, you can ask in the \href{https://community.aseprite.org/c/development}{\texttt{ Development category}} in the \href{https://community.aseprite.org/}{\texttt{ Community site}} for help or creating a \href{https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/new}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub issue}}.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Contributing}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md4}
One of the easiest ways to contribute is writing articles, \href{https://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/reviews/}{\texttt{ Steam reviews}}, blog posts, recording video tutorials, \href{https://aseprite.deviantart.com/}{\texttt{ creating pixel art}}, or showing your love to Aseprite e.\+g. naming Aseprite in your website and linking it to \href{https://www.aseprite.org/}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+aseprite.\+org/}}, following \href{https://twitter.com/aseprite}{\texttt{ @aseprite}} twitter account, or \href{https://www.aseprite.org/download/}{\texttt{ buying an extra Aseprite copy to your friend}}.

Other ways to contribute require direct contact with us. For example\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/aseprite/docs}{\texttt{ Writing documentation}}.
\item Making art with Aseprite and for Aseprite (logos, skins, mockups).
\item Sending patches for features or bug fixes.
\item Reviewing issues in the \href{https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues}{\texttt{ issue tracker}} and making comments.
\item Helping other users in the \href{https://community.aseprite.org/}{\texttt{ Community}} site.

You can start seeing the \href{https://www.aseprite.org/docs/}{\texttt{ documentation}}, and \href{mailto:support@aseprite.org}{\texttt{ contact us}} if you want to help writting documentation or recording \href{https://www.aseprite.org/docs/tutorial/}{\texttt{ tutorials}}.

If you are going to write documentation, we recommend you to take screenshots or record a GIF animations to show steps\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item As screen recording software, on Windows you can generate GIF files using \href{http://www.cockos.com/licecap/}{\texttt{ LICEcap}}.
\item You can upload the PNG/\+GIF images to \href{http://imgur.com/}{\texttt{ Imgur}}.

You can \href{https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues}{\texttt{ review issues}}, make comments, or create new \href{https://community.aseprite.org/c/features}{\texttt{ features}}, \href{https://community.aseprite.org/c/bugs}{\texttt{ bug reports}}, etc. You are encouraged to create mockups for any issue you see and attach them.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Hacking}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md7}
The first thing to keep in mind if you want to modify the source code\+: checkout the {\bfseries{main}} branch. It is the branch that we use to develop new features and fix issues that are planned for the next big release. See the \mbox{\hyperlink{md__ase_sprite_aseprite__i_n_s_t_a_l_l}{INSTALL}} guide to know how to compile.

To start looking the source code, see how it is organized in \href{https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/tree/main/src/\#aseprite-source-code}{\texttt{ src/\+README.\+md}} file.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Forking \& Pull Requests}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md8}
You can fork the Git\+Hub repository using the Fork button at \href{https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/aseprite/aseprite}}.

The Pull Requests (PR) systems works in this way\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item First of all you will need to sign our \href{https://github.com/igarastudio/cla}{\texttt{ Contributor License Agreement}} (CLA).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Then you can start working on Aseprite. Create a new branch from {\ttfamily main}, e.\+g. {\ttfamily fix-\/8} to fix the issue 8. Check this guide about \href{https://github.com/agis/git-style-guide\#branches}{\texttt{ how to name your branch}}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Start working on that new branch, and push your commits to your fork.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Create a new PR to merge your {\ttfamily fix-\/8} branch to the official {\ttfamily main}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If the PR is accepted (does not require review/comments/modifications), your branch is merged into {\ttfamily main}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item You will need to pull changes from the official {\ttfamily main} branch, and merge them in your own {\ttfamily main} branch. Finally you can discard your own {\ttfamily fix-\/8} branch (because those changes should be already merged into {\ttfamily main} if the PR was accepted).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Continue working from the new {\ttfamily main} head.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To keep in mind\+: {\bfseries{always}} start working from the {\ttfamily main} head, if you want to fix three different issues, create three different branches from {\ttfamily main} and then send three different PR. Do not chain all the fixes in one single branch. E.\+g. {\ttfamily fix-\/issues-\/3-\/and-\/8-\/and-\/25}.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{Community}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md9}
You can use the \href{https://community.aseprite.org/c/development}{\texttt{ Development category}} to ask question about the code, how to compile, etc. If you want to start working in something (\href{https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues}{\texttt{ issue}}, \href{https://community.aseprite.org/c/bugs}{\texttt{ bug}}, or \href{https://community.aseprite.org/c/features}{\texttt{ feature}}), post a comment asking if somebody is already working on that, in that way you can avoid start programming in something that is already done for the next release or which someone else is working on.

And always remember to take a look at our \href{http://www.aseprite.org/roadmap/}{\texttt{ roadmap}}.
