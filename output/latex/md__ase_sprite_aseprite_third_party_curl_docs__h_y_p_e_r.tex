Hyper is a separate \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} library written in Rust. curl can be told to use this library as a backend to deal with \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}}.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_y_p_e_r_autotoc_md989}{}\doxysection{Experimental!}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_y_p_e_r_autotoc_md989}
Hyper support in curl is considered {\bfseries{EXPERIMENTAL}} until further notice. It needs to be explicitly enabled at build-\/time.

Further development and tweaking of the Hyper backend support in curl will happen in in the master branch using pull-\/requests, just like ordinary changes.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_y_p_e_r_autotoc_md990}{}\doxysection{Hyper version}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_y_p_e_r_autotoc_md990}
The C API for Hyper is brand new and is still under development.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_y_p_e_r_autotoc_md991}{}\doxysection{build curl with hyper}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_y_p_e_r_autotoc_md991}
Build hyper and enable the C API\+: \begin{DoxyVerb} % git clone https://github.com/hyperium/hyper
 % cd hyper
 % RUSTFLAGS="--cfg hyper_unstable_ffi" cargo build --features client,http1,http2,ffi
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Build curl to use hyper\textquotesingle{}s C API\+: \begin{DoxyVerb} % git clone https://github.com/curl/curl
 % cd curl
 % ./buildconf
 % ./configure --with-hyper=<hyper dir>
 % make

Hyper is a low level \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} transport library. curl itself provides all \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} headers and Hyper provides all received headers back to curl.

Therefore, most of the \char`\"{}header logic\char`\"{} in curl as in responding to and acting on specific input and output headers are done the same way in curl code.

The API in Hyper delivers received \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} headers as (cleaned up) name=value pairs, making it impossible for curl to know the exact byte representation over the wire with Hyper.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_y_p_e_r_autotoc_md993}{}\doxysubsection{Limitations}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_y_p_e_r_autotoc_md993}
