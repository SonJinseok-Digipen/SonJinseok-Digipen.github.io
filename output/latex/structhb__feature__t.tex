\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\mbox{\hyperlink{structhb__feature__t}{hb\+\_\+feature\+\_\+t}}\+: @tag\+: The hb\+\_\+tag\+\_\+t tag of the feature @value\+: The value of the feature. 0 disables the feature, non-\/zero (usually 1) enables the feature. For features implemented as lookup type 3 (like \textquotesingle{}salt\textquotesingle{}) the @value is a one based index into the alternates. @start\+: the cluster to start applying this feature setting (inclusive). @end\+: the cluster to end applying this feature setting (exclusive).

The \mbox{\hyperlink{structhb__feature__t}{hb\+\_\+feature\+\_\+t}} is the structure that holds information about requested feature application. The feature will be applied with the given value to all glyphs which are in clusters between @start (inclusive) and @end (exclusive). Setting start to HB\+\_\+\+FEATURE\+\_\+\+GLOBAL\+\_\+\+START and end to HB\+\_\+\+FEATURE\+\_\+\+GLOBAL\+\_\+\+END specifies that the feature always applies to the entire buffer. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
