\item Add dlg\+\_\+get\+\_\+handler to allow handler chaining for debugging \mbox{[}api addition\mbox{]}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{dlg_8h_source}{dlg.\+h}} previously required DLG\+\_\+\+DISABLE to be defined to 1, this was already documented differently in api.\+md and examples. Now it\textquotesingle{}s enough if DLG\+\_\+\+DISABLE is defined at all \mbox{[}breaking change\mbox{]}
\item rework dlg\+\_\+\+\_\+strip\+\_\+root\+\_\+path to actually check for prefix. If the base path isn\textquotesingle{}t a prefix of the file, we won\textquotesingle{}t strip it.
\item change naming of header guard to not start with underscore

=== Release of v0.\+2.\+2 ===

2018-\/5-\/20 Rework the tags array building macro due to new errors in gcc8. Seems like the C++ way was undefined behavior before, now uses initializer\+\_\+list.

2018-\/3-\/20 Fix default\+\_\+output\+\_\+handler output on wsl, add option to disable special windows console handling. Also add options to always use color in default output handler (to work around wsl color limitation).

2018-\/3-\/19 \mbox{\hyperlink{dlg_8hpp_source}{dlg.\+hpp}}\+: Allow tlformat (default \mbox{\hyperlink{dlg_8hpp_source}{dlg.\+hpp}} formatter) to be called with just a non-\/string object (which will then just be printed)

2018-\/01-\/17 \mbox{\hyperlink{output_8h_source}{output.\+h}}\+: add dlg\+\_\+output\+\_\+msecs for more time output precision

=== Release of v0.\+2.\+1 ===
