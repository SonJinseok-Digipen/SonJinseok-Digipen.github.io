Depending on the specific type of issue, other information will be helpful\+:\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_libarchive__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1789}{}\doxysubsection{Test Failures}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_libarchive__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1789}
If you see any test failures, please include the information above and also\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_names}{Names}} of the tests that failed.
\item Look for the .log files in the /tmp/libarchive\+\_\+test\+\_\+$\ast$date-\/and-\/time$\ast$ directories. (On Mac OS, look in \$\+TMPDIR which is different than /tmp.)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Please paste the .log files you will find there directly into your report.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_libarchive__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1790}{}\doxysubsection{Problems using libarchive in a program}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_libarchive__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1790}
If you are trying to write a program using libarchive, please include the information above and also\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It will help us if we can actually run the program. This is easiest if you can provide source to a short program that illustrates your problem.
\item If you have a sufficiently short program that shows the problem, you can either paste it into the report or \href{https://gist.github.com}{\texttt{ put it into a gist}}.

Please tell us what program you ran, any command-\/line arguments you provided, and details of the input files ({\ttfamily ls -\/l} output is helpful here). If the problem involved a command-\/line program, please copy the full terminal text into the report, including the command line and any error messages.

Please try to make the output file available to us. Unless it is very large, you can upload it into a fresh github repository and provide a link in your issue report.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_libarchive__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1792}{}\doxysubsection{Libarchive could not read a particular input file}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_libarchive__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1792}
Note\+: If you can provide a {\bfseries{very small}} input file that reproduces the problem, we can add that to our test suite. This will ensure that the bug does not reappear in the future.

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_a}{A}} link to the relevant file is usually sufficient.

If you cannot provide the input file or a link to the file, please let us know if there is some other way to obtain it.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_libarchive__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1793}{}\doxysubsection{Documentation improvements}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_libarchive__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1793}
We are always interested in improving the libarchive documentation. Please tell us about any errors you find, including\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Typos or errors in the manpages provided with libarchive source.
\item Mistakes in the \href{https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/wiki}{\texttt{ libarchive Wiki}}
\item Problems with the PDF or Wiki files that are automatically generated from the manpages.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_libarchive__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1794}{}\doxysection{Code Submissions}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_libarchive__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1794}
We welcome all code submissions. But of course, some code submissions are easier for us to respond to than others. The best code submissions\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Address a single issue. There have been many cases where a simple fix to an obvious problem did not get handled for months because the patch that was provided also included an unrelated change affecting an especially complex area of the code.
\item Follow existing libarchive code style and conventions. Libarchive generally follows \href{https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9}{\texttt{ BSD KNF}} for formatting code.
\item Do not make unnecessary changes to existing whitespace, capitalization, or spelling.
\item Include detailed instructions for reproducing the problem you\textquotesingle{}re fixing. We do try to verify that a submission actually fixes a real problem. If we can\textquotesingle{}t reproduce the problem, it will take us longer to evaluate the fix. For this reason, we encourage you to file an issue report first with details on reproducing the problem, then refer to that issue in your pull request.
\item Includes a test case. The libarchive Wiki has \href{https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/wiki/LibarchiveAddingTest}{\texttt{ detailed documentation for adding new test cases}}.
\item Are provided via Github pull requests. We welcome patches in almost any format, but github\textquotesingle{}s pull request management makes it significantly easier for us to evaluate and test changes.
