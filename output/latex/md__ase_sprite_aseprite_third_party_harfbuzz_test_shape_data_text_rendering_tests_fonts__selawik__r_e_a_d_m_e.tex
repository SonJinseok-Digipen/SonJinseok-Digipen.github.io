This version of Selawik is a test case and demonstration of Open\+Type 1.\+8 Font Variations technology and tables. It also includes some handy debugging characters.

This version of Selawik is intended for testing only, and is not recommended for shipping in applications, etc. For that, it is better to use the main branch of \href{https://github.com/Microsoft/Selawik}{\texttt{ Selawik}}.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_harfbuzz_test_shape_data_text_rendering_tests_fonts__selawik__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1427}{}\doxysection{Features}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_harfbuzz_test_shape_data_text_rendering_tests_fonts__selawik__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1427}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Full True\+Type hinting with VTT source tables included. See Hinting for details.
\item All tables required for Open\+Type 1.\+8 are present (see Table Status, below). This includes cvar (varied CVTs), GPOS/\+GDEF (kerning varies), and avar (coordinate space warping to match Segoe UI).

Note\+: This version of Selawik does not include an MVAR because its vertical metrics do not change anywhere in the design space, thus there is no need for MVAR. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a}{A}} future release will contain an axis that varies vertical metrics as an excuse to have an MVAR.
\item Numerous interesting debugging glyphs (requires liga to be enabled). For example, \textbackslash{}axis1 will show the current normalized wght coordinate. See Debugging Glyphs for details.
\item 1 axis\+: weight

The following tables are currently supported\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} fvar
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} gvar
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} cvar
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} avar (to match Segoe UI weights and metrics)
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} STAT
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} GPOS/\+GDEF -\/ kerning
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} HVAR
\end{DoxyItemize}

Not yet complete\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} GSUB/\+GDEF -\/ to change dollar signs in the bold
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} MVAR (future release)

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add a second axis that varies vertical metrics so we need an MVAR table. This axis will not be one of the standard axes listed in the \mbox{[}Open\+Type 1.\+8 specification\mbox{]} (\href{https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/fvar.htm}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+microsoft.\+com/typography/otspec/fvar.\+htm}}), so that it becomes an example of out to do a foundry-\/defined axis.
\item Add Feature Variations (GPOS/\+GDEF) to switch dollar sign glyphs across weights.

Thanks to Greg Hitchcock\textquotesingle{}s True\+Type coding wizardry, this font includes many glyphs that are helpful for debugging implementations of variable fonts. It has a number of substitutions implemented as liga features\+:

The circle changes weight (and size) in opposition to the rest of the font\+: lighter at bold weights and vice versa. Thus, if you use this character and see both the circle and bar look bold, you\textquotesingle{}re not looking at a true bold instance, but an algorithmically emboldened one.    \\\cline{1-2}

This version of Selawik is primarily hinted with the light Latin hinting style Microsoft recommends for variable Latin fonts. The VTT Light Latin autohinter was used to create the first round of hints, which were then reviewed and touched up.

This hinting style only uses CVTs for vertical metrics anchors (ascender, descender, cap height, x-\/height, and baseline). While this makes for an easy job hinting a Latin font, it makes for a poor test case because Selawik doesn\textquotesingle{}t vary vertical metrics with weight, thus doesn\textquotesingle{}t vary CVTs, thus doesn\textquotesingle{}t need a cvar. So, to make it more interesting, we added CVT-\/based stem hints to the lowercase only. This provided the need to vary CVTs and thus require a cvar. Note that this was only done for testing purposes. For variable fonts, Microsoft recommends the light hinting style using the {\ttfamily Res\+YDist()} command instead of a CVT-\/based stem hint.
