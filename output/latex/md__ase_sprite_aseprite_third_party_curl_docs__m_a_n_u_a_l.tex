It is just like for \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}}, but you may also want to specify and use SSL-\/specific options for certificates etc.

Note that using {\ttfamily FTPS\+://} as prefix is the \char`\"{}implicit\char`\"{} way as described in the standards while the recommended \char`\"{}explicit\char`\"{} way is done by using \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}}\+:// and the {\ttfamily -\/-\/ftp-\/ssl} option.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1094}{}\doxysubsection{SFTP / SCP}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1094}
This is similar to \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}}, but you can use the {\ttfamily -\/-\/key} option to specify a private key to use instead of a password. Note that the private key may itself be protected by a password that is unrelated to the login password of the remote system; this password is specified using the {\ttfamily -\/-\/pass} option. Typically, curl will automatically extract the public key from the private key file, but in cases where curl does not have the proper library support, a matching public key file must be specified using the {\ttfamily -\/-\/pubkey} option.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1095}{}\doxysubsection{HTTP}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1095}
Curl also supports user and password in \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} URLs, thus you can pick a file like\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl http://name:passwd@machine.domain/full/path/to/file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 or specify user and password separately like in \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -u name:passwd http://machine.domain/full/path/to/file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} offers many different methods of authentication and curl supports several\+: Basic, Digest, NTLM and Negotiate (SPNEGO). Without telling which method to use, curl defaults to Basic. You can also ask curl to pick the most secure ones out of the ones that the server accepts for the given URL, by using {\ttfamily -\/-\/anyauth}.

{\bfseries{Note}}! According to the URL specification, \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} URLs can not contain a user and password, so that style will not work when using curl via a proxy, even though curl allows it at other times. When using a proxy, you {\itshape must} use the {\ttfamily -\/u} style for user and password.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1096}{}\doxysubsection{HTTPS}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1096}
Probably most commonly used with private certificates, as explained below.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1097}{}\doxysection{Proxy}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1097}
curl supports both \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} and SOCKS proxy servers, with optional authentication. It does not have special support for \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} proxy servers since there are no standards for those, but it can still be made to work with many of them. You can also use both \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} and SOCKS proxies to transfer files to and from \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} servers.

Get an ftp file using an \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} proxy named my-\/proxy that uses port 888\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -x my-proxy:888 ftp://ftp.leachsite.com/README
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Get a file from an \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} server that requires user and password, using the same proxy as above\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -u user:passwd -x my-proxy:888 http://www.get.this/
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Some proxies require special authentication. Specify by using -\/U as above\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -U user:passwd -x my-proxy:888 http://www.get.this/
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a}{A}} comma-\/separated list of hosts and domains which do not use the proxy can be specified as\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl --noproxy localhost,get.this -x my-proxy:888 http://www.get.this/
\end{DoxyVerb}
 If the proxy is specified with {\ttfamily -\/-\/proxy1.\+0} instead of {\ttfamily -\/-\/proxy} or {\ttfamily -\/x}, then curl will use HTTP/1.\+0 instead of HTTP/1.\+1 for any {\ttfamily CONNECT} attempts.

curl also supports SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies with {\ttfamily -\/-\/socks4} and {\ttfamily -\/-\/socks5}.

See also the environment variables Curl supports that offer further proxy control.

Most \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} proxy servers are set up to appear as a normal \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} server from the client\textquotesingle{}s perspective, with special commands to select the remote \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} server. curl supports the {\ttfamily -\/u}, {\ttfamily -\/Q} and {\ttfamily -\/-\/ftp-\/account} options that can be used to set up transfers through many \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} proxies. For example, a file can be uploaded to a remote \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} server using a Blue Coat \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} proxy with the options\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -u "username@ftp.server Proxy-Username:Remote-Pass"
  --ftp-account Proxy-Password --upload-file local-file
  ftp://my-ftp.proxy.server:21/remote/upload/path/
\end{DoxyVerb}
 See the manual for your \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} proxy to determine the form it expects to set up transfers, and curl\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily -\/v} option to see exactly what curl is sending.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1098}{}\doxysection{Ranges}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1098}
\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} 1.\+1 introduced byte-\/ranges. Using this, a client can request to get only one or more subparts of a specified document. Curl supports this with the {\ttfamily -\/r} flag.

Get the first 100 bytes of a document\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -r 0-99 http://www.get.this/
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Get the last 500 bytes of a document\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -r -500 http://www.get.this/
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Curl also supports simple ranges for \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} files as well. Then you can only specify start and stop position.

Get the first 100 bytes of a document using \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -r 0-99 ftp://www.get.this/README

If curl fails where it isn\textquotesingle{}t supposed to, if the servers don\textquotesingle{}t let you in, if you can\textquotesingle{}t understand the responses\+: use the {\ttfamily -\/v} flag to get verbose fetching. Curl will output lots of info and what it sends and receives in order to let the user see all client-\/server interaction (but it won\textquotesingle{}t show you the actual data). \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -v ftp://ftp.upload.com/
\end{DoxyVerb}
 To get even more details and information on what curl does, try using the {\ttfamily -\/-\/trace} or {\ttfamily -\/-\/trace-\/ascii} options with a given file name to log to, like this\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl --trace trace.txt www.haxx.se

Different protocols provide different ways of getting detailed information about specific files/documents. To get curl to show detailed information about a single file, you should use {\ttfamily -\/I}/{\ttfamily -\/-\/head} option. It displays all available info on a single file for \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}}. The \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} information is a lot more extensive.

For \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}}, you can get the header information (the same as {\ttfamily -\/I} would show) shown before the data by using {\ttfamily -\/i}/{\ttfamily -\/-\/include}. Curl understands the {\ttfamily -\/D}/{\ttfamily -\/-\/dump-\/header} option when getting files from both \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}}, and it will then store the headers in the specified file.

Store the \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} headers in a separate file (headers.\+txt in the example)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  curl --dump-header headers.txt curl.se
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Note that headers stored in a separate file can be very useful at a later time if you want curl to use cookies sent by the server. More about that in the cookies section.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1105}{}\doxysection{POST (\+HTTP)}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1105}
It\textquotesingle{}s easy to post data using curl. This is done using the {\ttfamily -\/d \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}data\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} option. The post data must be urlencoded.

Post a simple \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}phone\char`\"{} guestbook. \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -d "name=Rafael%20Sagula&phone=3320780" http://www.where.com/guest.cgi
\end{DoxyVerb}
 How to post a form with curl, lesson \#1\+:

Dig out all the {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}input\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} tags in the form that you want to fill in.

If there\textquotesingle{}s a \char`\"{}normal\char`\"{} post, you use {\ttfamily -\/d} to post. {\ttfamily -\/d} takes a full \char`\"{}post string\char`\"{}, which is in the format \begin{DoxyVerb}<variable1>=<data1>&<variable2>=<data2>&...
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The \textquotesingle{}variable\textquotesingle{} names are the names set with {\ttfamily \char`\"{}name=\char`\"{}} in the {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}input\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} tags, and the data is the contents you want to fill in for the inputs. The data {\itshape must} be properly URL encoded. That means you replace space with + and that you replace weird letters with XX where XX is the hexadecimal representation of the letter\textquotesingle{}s ASCII code.

Example\+:

(page located at {\ttfamily \href{http://www.formpost.com/getthis/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+formpost.\+com/getthis/}}})


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{<form\ action="{}post.cgi"{}\ method="{}post"{}>}
\DoxyCodeLine{<input\ name=user\ size=10>}
\DoxyCodeLine{<input\ name=pass\ type=password\ size=10>}
\DoxyCodeLine{<input\ name=id\ type=hidden\ value="{}blablabla"{}>}
\DoxyCodeLine{<input\ name=ding\ value="{}submit"{}>}
\DoxyCodeLine{</form>}

\end{DoxyCode}


We want to enter user \textquotesingle{}foobar\textquotesingle{} with password \textquotesingle{}12345\textquotesingle{}.

To post to this, you enter a curl command line like\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -d "user=foobar&pass=12345&id=blablabla&ding=submit"
  http://www.formpost.com/getthis/post.cgi
\end{DoxyVerb}
 While {\ttfamily -\/d} uses the application/x-\/www-\/form-\/urlencoded mime-\/type, generally understood by CGI\textquotesingle{}s and similar, curl also supports the more capable multipart/form-\/data type. This latter type supports things like file upload.

{\ttfamily -\/F} accepts parameters like {\ttfamily -\/F \char`\"{}name=contents\char`\"{}}. If you want the contents to be read from a file, use {\ttfamily @filename} as contents. When specifying a file, you can also specify the file content type by appending {\ttfamily ;type=\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}mime type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} to the file name. You can also post the contents of several files in one field. For example, the field name \textquotesingle{}coolfiles\textquotesingle{} is used to send three files, with different content types using the following syntax\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -F "coolfiles=@fil1.gif;type=image/gif,fil2.txt,fil3.html"
  http://www.post.com/postit.cgi
\end{DoxyVerb}
 If the content-\/type is not specified, curl will try to guess from the file extension (it only knows a few), or use the previously specified type (from an earlier file if several files are specified in a list) or else it will use the default type \textquotesingle{}application/octet-\/stream\textquotesingle{}.

Emulate a fill-\/in form with {\ttfamily -\/F}. Let\textquotesingle{}s say you fill in three fields in a form. One field is a file name which to post, one field is your name and one field is a file description. We want to post the file we have written named \char`\"{}cooltext.\+txt\char`\"{}. To let curl do the posting of this data instead of your favourite browser, you have to read the HTML source of the form page and find the names of the input fields. In our example, the input field names are \textquotesingle{}file\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}yourname\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}filedescription\textquotesingle{}. \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -F "file=@cooltext.txt" -F "yourname=Daniel"
  -F "filedescription=Cool text file with cool text inside"
  http://www.post.com/postit.cgi
\end{DoxyVerb}
 To send two files in one post you can do it in two ways\+:

Send multiple files in a single \char`\"{}field\char`\"{} with a single field name\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -F "pictures=@dog.gif,cat.gif" $URL
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Send two fields with two field names \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -F "docpicture=@dog.gif" -F "catpicture=@cat.gif" $URL
\end{DoxyVerb}
 To send a field value literally without interpreting a leading {\ttfamily @} or {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}}, or an embedded {\ttfamily ;type=}, use {\ttfamily -\/-\/form-\/string} instead of {\ttfamily -\/F}. This is recommended when the value is obtained from a user or some other unpredictable source. Under these circumstances, using {\ttfamily -\/F} instead of {\ttfamily -\/-\/form-\/string} could allow a user to trick curl into uploading a file.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1106}{}\doxysection{Referrer}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1106}
An \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} request has the option to include information about which address referred it to the actual page. Curl allows you to specify the referrer to be used on the command line. It is especially useful to fool or trick stupid servers or CGI scripts that rely on that information being available or contain certain data. \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -e www.coolsite.com http://www.showme.com/

Cookies are generally used by web servers to keep state information at the client\textquotesingle{}s side. The server sets cookies by sending a response line in the headers that looks like {\ttfamily Set-\/\+Cookie\+: \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}data\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} where the data part then typically contains a set of {\ttfamily NAME=VALUE} pairs (separated by semicolons {\ttfamily ;} like {\ttfamily NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2;}). The server can also specify for what path the \char`\"{}cookie\char`\"{} should be used for (by specifying {\ttfamily path=value}), when the cookie should expire ({\ttfamily expire=DATE}), for what domain to use it ({\ttfamily domain=NAME}) and if it should be used on secure connections only ({\ttfamily secure}).

If you\textquotesingle{}ve received a page from a server that contains a header like\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Set-\/Cookie:\ sessionid=boo123;\ path="{}/foo"{};}

\end{DoxyCode}


it means the server wants that first pair passed on when we get anything in a path beginning with \char`\"{}/foo\char`\"{}.

Example, get a page that wants my name passed in a cookie\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -b "name=Daniel" www.sillypage.com
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Curl also has the ability to use previously received cookies in following sessions. If you get cookies from a server and store them in a file in a manner similar to\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl --dump-header headers www.example.com

 ... you can then in a second connect to that (or another) site, use the cookies from the \textquotesingle{}headers\textquotesingle{} file like\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -b headers www.example.com
\end{DoxyVerb}
 While saving headers to a file is a working way to store cookies, it is however error-\/prone and not the preferred way to do this. Instead, make curl save the incoming cookies using the well-\/known netscape cookie format like this\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -c cookies.txt www.example.com
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Note that by specifying {\ttfamily -\/b} you enable the \char`\"{}cookie awareness\char`\"{} and with {\ttfamily -\/L} you can make curl follow a location\+: (which often is used in combination with cookies). So that if a site sends cookies and a location, you can use a non-\/existing file to trigger the cookie awareness like\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -L -b empty.txt www.example.com
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The file to read cookies from must be formatted using plain \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} headers OR as netscape\textquotesingle{}s cookie file. Curl will determine what kind it is based on the file contents. In the above command, curl will parse the header and store the cookies received from www.\+example.\+com. curl will send to the server the stored cookies which match the request as it follows the location. The file \char`\"{}empty.\+txt\char`\"{} may be a nonexistent file.

To read and write cookies from a netscape cookie file, you can set both {\ttfamily -\/b} and {\ttfamily -\/c} to use the same file\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt www.example.com

Curl allows the user to set the transfer speed conditions that must be met to let the transfer keep going. By using the switch {\ttfamily -\/y} and {\ttfamily -\/Y} you can make curl abort transfers if the transfer speed is below the specified lowest limit for a specified time.

To have curl abort the download if the speed is slower than 3000 bytes per second for 1 minute, run\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -Y 3000 -y 60 www.far-away-site.com
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This can very well be used in combination with the overall time limit, so that the above operation must be completed in whole within 30 minutes\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -m 1800 -Y 3000 -y 60 www.far-away-site.com
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Forcing curl not to transfer data faster than a given rate is also possible, which might be useful if you\textquotesingle{}re using a limited bandwidth connection and you don\textquotesingle{}t want your transfer to use all of it (sometimes referred to as \char`\"{}bandwidth throttle\char`\"{}).

Make curl transfer data no faster than 10 kilobytes per second\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl --limit-rate 10K www.far-away-site.com
\end{DoxyVerb}
 or \begin{DoxyVerb}curl --limit-rate 10240 www.far-away-site.com
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Or prevent curl from uploading data faster than 1 megabyte per second\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -T upload --limit-rate 1M ftp://uploadshereplease.com
\end{DoxyVerb}
 When using the {\ttfamily -\/-\/limit-\/rate} option, the transfer rate is regulated on a per-\/second basis, which will cause the total transfer speed to become lower than the given number. Sometimes of course substantially lower, if your transfer stalls during periods.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1111}{}\doxysection{Config File}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__m_a_n_u_a_l_autotoc_md1111}
Curl automatically tries to read the {\ttfamily .curlrc} file (or {\ttfamily \+\_\+curlrc} file on Microsoft Windows systems) from the user\textquotesingle{}s home dir on startup.

The config file could be made up with normal command line switches, but you can also specify the long options without the dashes to make it more readable. You can separate the options and the parameter with spaces, or with {\ttfamily =} or {\ttfamily \+:}. Comments can be used within the file. If the first letter on a line is a {\ttfamily \#}-\/symbol the rest of the line is treated as a comment.

If you want the parameter to contain spaces, you must enclose the entire parameter within double quotes ({\ttfamily \char`\"{}$<$/tt$>$). Within those quotes, you specify a quote as $<$tt$>$\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}\char`\"{}$<$/tt$>$.  \+NOTE\+: You must specify options and their arguments on the same line.  \+Example, set default time out and proxy in a config file\+: @iverbatim  \# We want a 30 minute timeout\+: -\/m 1800 \# ... and we use a proxy for all accesses\+: proxy = proxy.\+our.\+domain.\+com\+:8080 @endiverbatim \+Whitespaces ARE significant at the end of lines, but all whitespace leading up to the first characters of each line are ignored.  \+Prevent curl from reading the default file by using -\/q as the first command line parameter, like\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/q www.\+thatsite.\+com @endiverbatim \+Force curl to get and display a local help page in case it is invoked without \+URL by making a config file similar to\+: @iverbatim  \# default url to get url = \char`\"{}\href{http://help.with.curl.com/curlhelp.html}{\texttt{ http\+://help.\+with.\+curl.\+com/curlhelp.\+html}}\char`\"{} @endiverbatim \+You can specify another config file to be read by using the $<$tt$>$-\/\+K$<$/tt$>$/$<$tt$>$-\/-\/config$<$/tt$>$ flag. If you set config file name to $<$tt$>$-\/$<$/tt$>$ it\textquotesingle{}ll read the config from stdin, which can be handy if you want to hide options from being visible in process tables etc\+: @iverbatim  echo \char`\"{}user = user\+:passwd\char`\"{} $\vert$ curl -\/\+K -\/ http\+://that.\+secret.\+site.\+com @endiverbatim @section autotoc\+\_\+md1112 Extra Headers  \+When using curl in your own very special programs, you may end up needing to pass on your own custom headers when getting a web page. You can do this by using the $<$tt$>$-\/\+H$<$/tt$>$ flag.  \+Example, send the header $<$tt$>$\+X-\/you-\/and-\/me\+: yes$<$/tt$>$ to the server when getting a page\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/\+H \char`\"{}X-\/you-\/and-\/me\+: yes\char`\"{} www.\+love.\+com @endiverbatim \+This can also be useful in case you want curl to send a different text in a header than it normally does. The $<$tt$>$-\/\+H$<$/tt$>$ header you specify then replaces the header curl would normally send. If you replace an internal header with an empty one, you prevent that header from being sent. To prevent the $<$tt$>$\+Host\+:$<$/tt$>$ header from being used\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/\+H \char`\"{}Host\+:\char`\"{} www.\+server.\+com @endiverbatim @section autotoc\+\_\+md1113 FTP and Path Names  \+Do note that when getting files with a $<$tt$>$ftp\+://$<$/tt$>$ URL, the given path is relative the directory you enter. To get the file $<$tt$>$\+README$<$/tt$>$ from your home directory at your ftp site, do\+: @iverbatim  curl ftp\+://user\+:passwd@my.\+site.\+com/\+README @endiverbatim \+But if you want the README file from the root directory of that very same site, you need to specify the absolute file name\+: @iverbatim  curl ftp\+://user\+:passwd@my.\+site.\+com//\+README @endiverbatim (\+I.\+e with an extra slash in front of the file name.)  @section autotoc\+\_\+md1114 SFTP and SCP and Path Names  \+With sftp\+: and scp\+: URLs, the path name given is the absolute name on the server. To access a file relative to the remote user\textquotesingle{}s home directory, prefix the file with $<$tt$>$/$\sim$/$<$/tt$>$ , such as\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/u \$\+USER sftp\+://home.\+example.\+com/$\sim$/.\+bashrc @endiverbatim @section autotoc\+\_\+md1115 FTP and Firewalls  \+The FTP protocol requires one of the involved parties to open a second connection as soon as data is about to get transferred. There are two ways to do this.  \+The default way for curl is to issue the PASV command which causes the server to open another port and await another connection performed by the client. This is good if the client is behind a firewall that doesn\textquotesingle{}t allow incoming connections. @iverbatim  curl ftp.\+download.\+com @endiverbatim \+If the server, for example, is behind a firewall that doesn\textquotesingle{}t allow connections on ports other than 21 (or if it just doesn\textquotesingle{}t support the $<$tt$>$\+PASV$<$/tt$>$ command), the other way to do it is to use the $<$tt$>$\+PORT$<$/tt$>$ command and instruct the server to connect to the client on the given IP number and port (as parameters to the PORT command).  \+The $<$tt$>$-\/\+P$<$/tt$>$ flag to curl supports a few different options. Your machine may have several IP-\/addresses and/or network interfaces and curl allows you to select which of them to use. Default address can also be used\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/\+P -\/ ftp.\+download.\+com @endiverbatim \+Download with $<$tt$>$\+PORT$<$/tt$>$ but use the IP address of our $<$tt$>$le0$<$/tt$>$ interface (this does not work on windows)\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/\+P le0 ftp.\+download.\+com @endiverbatim \+Download with $<$tt$>$\+PORT$<$/tt$>$ but use 192.\+168.\+0.\+10 as our IP address to use\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/\+P 192.\+168.\+0.\+10 ftp.\+download.\+com @endiverbatim @section autotoc\+\_\+md1116 Network Interface  \+Get a web page from a server using a specified port for the interface\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/-\/interface eth0\+:1 http\+://www.\+example.\+com/ @endiverbatim or @iverbatim  curl -\/-\/interface 192.\+168.\+1.\+10 http\+://www.\+example.\+com/ @endiverbatim @section autotoc\+\_\+md1117 HTTPS  \+Secure HTTP requires a TLS library to be installed and used when curl is built. If that is done, curl is capable of retrieving and posting documents using the HTTPS protocol.  \+Example\+: @iverbatim  curl https\+://www.\+secure-\/site.\+com @endiverbatim curl is also capable of using client certificates to get/post files from sites that require valid certificates. The only drawback is that the certificate needs to be in PEM-\/format. PEM is a standard and open format to store certificates with, but it is not used by the most commonly used browsers. If you want curl to use the certificates you use with your (favourite) browser, you may need to download/compile a converter that can convert your browser\textquotesingle{}s formatted certificates to PEM formatted ones.  \+Example on how to automatically retrieve a document using a certificate with a personal password\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/\+E /path/to/cert.\+pem\+:password https\+://secure.\+site.\+com/ @endiverbatim \+If you neglect to specify the password on the command line, you will be prompted for the correct password before any data can be received.  \+Many older HTTPS servers have problems with specific SSL or TLS versions, which newer versions of Open\+SSL etc use, therefore it is sometimes useful to specify what SSL-\/version curl should use. Use -\/3, -\/2 or -\/1 to specify that exact SSL version to use (for SSLv3, SSLv2 or TLSv1 respectively)\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/2 https\+://secure.\+site.\+com/ @endiverbatim \+Otherwise, curl will attempt to use a sensible TLS default version.  @section autotoc\+\_\+md1118 Resuming File Transfers  \+To continue a file transfer where it was previously aborted, curl supports resume on HTTP(\+S) downloads as well as FTP uploads and downloads.  \+Continue downloading a document\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/\+C -\/ -\/o file ftp\+://ftp.\+server.\+com/path/file @endiverbatim \+Continue uploading a document\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/\+C -\/ -\/\+T file ftp\+://ftp.\+server.\+com/path/file @endiverbatim \+Continue downloading a document from a web server @iverbatim  curl -\/\+C -\/ -\/o file http\+://www.\+server.\+com/ @endiverbatim @section autotoc\+\_\+md1119 Time Conditions  \+HTTP allows a client to specify a time condition for the document it requests. \+It is $<$tt$>$\+If-\/\+Modified-\/\+Since$<$/tt$>$ or $<$tt$>$\+If-\/\+Unmodified-\/\+Since$<$/tt$>$. curl allows you to specify them with the $<$tt$>$-\/z$<$/tt$>$/$<$tt$>$-\/-\/time-\/cond$<$/tt$>$ flag.  \+For example, you can easily make a download that only gets performed if the remote file is newer than a local copy. It would be made like\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/z local.\+html http\+://remote.\+server.\+com/remote.\+html @endiverbatim \+Or you can download a file only if the local file is newer than the remote one. Do this by prepending the date string with a $<$tt$>$-\/$<$/tt$>$, as in\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/z -\/local.\+html http\+://remote.\+server.\+com/remote.\+html @endiverbatim \+You can specify a \char`\"{}free text\char`\"{} date as condition. Tell curl to only download the file if it was updated since January 12, 2012\+: @iverbatim  curl -\/z \char`\"{}Jan 12 2012\char`\"{} http\+://remote.\+server.\+com/remote.\+html @endiverbatim \+Curl will then accept a wide range of date formats. You always make the date check the other way around by prepending it with a dash ($<$tt$>$-\/$<$/tt$>$).  @section autotoc\+\_\+md1120 DICT  \+For fun try @iverbatim  curl dict\+://dict.\+org/m\+:curl curl dict\+://dict.\+org/d\+:heisenbug\+:jargon curl dict\+://dict.\+org/d\+:daniel\+:gcide @endiverbatim \+Aliases for \textquotesingle{}m\textquotesingle{} are \textquotesingle{}match\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}find\textquotesingle{}, and aliases for \textquotesingle{}d\textquotesingle{} are \textquotesingle{}define\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}lookup\textquotesingle{}. For example, @iverbatim  curl dict\+://dict.\+org/find\+:curl @endiverbatim \+Commands that break the URL description of the RFC (but not the DICT protocol) are @iverbatim  curl dict\+://dict.\+org/show\+:db curl dict\+://dict.\+org/show\+:strat @endiverbatim \+Authentication support is still missing  @section autotoc\+\_\+md1121 LDAP  \+If you have installed the Open\+LDAP library, curl can take advantage of it and offer $<$tt$>$ldap\+://$<$/tt$>$ support.
