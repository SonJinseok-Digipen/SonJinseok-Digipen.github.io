The goal is to add tests for {\itshape all} functions in libcurl. If functions are too big and complicated, we should split them into smaller and testable ones.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_tests_unit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1360}{}\doxysection{Build Unit Tests}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_tests_unit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1360}
{\ttfamily ./configure -\/-\/enable-\/debug} is required for the unit tests to build. To enable unit tests, there will be a separate static libcurl built that will be used exclusively for linking unit test programs. Just build everything as normal, and then you can run the unit test cases as well.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_tests_unit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1361}{}\doxysection{Run Unit Tests}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_tests_unit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1361}
Unit tests are run as part of the regular test suite. If you have built everything to run unit tests, to can do \textquotesingle{}make test\textquotesingle{} at the root level. Or you can {\ttfamily cd tests} and {\ttfamily make} and then invoke individual unit tests with {\ttfamily ./runtests.pl NNNN} where {\ttfamily NNNN} is the specific test number.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_tests_unit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1362}{}\doxysection{Debug Unit Tests}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_tests_unit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1362}
If a specific test fails you will get told. The test case then has output left in the log/ subdirectory, but most importantly you can re-\/run the test again using gdb by doing {\ttfamily ./runtests.pl -\/g NNNN}. That is, add a {\ttfamily -\/g} to make it start up gdb and run the same case using that.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_tests_unit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1363}{}\doxysection{Write Unit Tests}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_tests_unit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1363}
We put tests that focus on an area or a specific function into a single C source file. The source file should be named \textquotesingle{}unit\+NNNN.\+c\textquotesingle{} where NNNN is a previously unused number.

Add your test to {\ttfamily tests/unit/\+Makefile.\+inc} (if it is a unit test). Add your test data file name to {\ttfamily tests/data/\+Makefile.\+inc}

You also need a separate file called {\ttfamily tests/data/test\+NNNN} (using the same number) that describes your test case. See the test1300 file for inspiration and the {\ttfamily tests/\+FILEFORMAT.\+md} documentation.

For the actual C file, here\textquotesingle{}s a very simple example\+: $\sim$$\sim$$\sim$c \#include \char`\"{}curlcheck.\+h\char`\"{}

\#include \char`\"{}a libcurl header.\+h\char`\"{} /$\ast$ from the lib dir $\ast$/

static CURLcode unit\+\_\+setup( void ) \{ /$\ast$ whatever you want done first $\ast$/ return CURLE\+\_\+\+OK; \}

static void unit\+\_\+stop( void ) \{ /$\ast$ done before shutting down and exiting $\ast$/ \}

UNITTEST\+\_\+\+START

/$\ast$ here you start doing things and checking that the results are good $\ast$/

fail\+\_\+unless( size == 0 , \char`\"{}initial size should be zero\char`\"{} ); fail\+\_\+if( head == NULL , \char`\"{}head should not be initiated to NULL\char`\"{} );

/$\ast$ you end the test code like this\+: $\ast$/

UNITTEST\+\_\+\+STOP
