Towards the end of 1996, Daniel Stenberg was spending time writing an IRC bot for an Amiga related channel on EFnet. He then came up with the idea to make currency-\/exchange calculations available to Internet Relay Chat (IRC) users. All the necessary data were published on the Web; he just needed to automate their retrieval.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md927}{}\doxysection{1996}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md927}
On November 11, 1996 the Brazilian developer Rafael Sagula wrote and released Http\+Get version 0.\+1.

Daniel extended this existing command-\/line open-\/source tool. After a few minor adjustments, it did just what he needed. The first release with Daniel\textquotesingle{}s additions was 0.\+2, released on December 17, 1996. Daniel quickly became the new maintainer of the project.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md928}{}\doxysection{1997}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md928}
Http\+Get 0.\+3 was released in January 1997 and now it accepted \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} URLs on the command line.

Http\+Get 1.\+0 was released on April 8th 1997 with brand new \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} proxy support.

We soon found and fixed support for getting currencies over GOPHER. Once \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} download support was added, the name of the project was changed and urlget 2.\+0 was released in August 1997. The http-\/only days were already passed.

Version 2.\+2 was released on August 14 1997 and introduced support to build for and run on Windows and Solaris.

November 24 1997\+: Version 3.\+1 added \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} upload support.

Version 3.\+5 added support for \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} POST.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md929}{}\doxysection{1998}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md929}
February 4\+: urlget 3.\+10

February 9\+: urlget 3.\+11

March 14\+: urlget 3.\+12 added proxy authentication.

The project slowly grew bigger. With upload capabilities, the name was once again misleading and a second name change was made. On March 20, 1998 curl 4 was released. (The version numbering from the previous names was kept.)

(Unrelated to this project a company called Curl Corporation registered a US trademark on the name \char`\"{}\+CURL\char`\"{} on May 18 1998. That company had then already registered the curl.\+com domain back in November of the previous year. All this was revealed to us much later.)

SSL support was added, powered by the SSLeay library.

August\+: first announcement of curl on freshmeat.\+net.

October\+: with the curl 4.\+9 release and the introduction of cookie support, curl was no longer released under the GPL license. Now we\textquotesingle{}re at 4000 lines of code, we switched over to the MPL license to restrict the effects of \char`\"{}copyleft\char`\"{}.

November\+: configure script and reported successful compiles on several major operating systems. The never-\/quite-\/understood -\/F option was added and curl could now simulate quite a lot of a browser. \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_t_e_l_n_e_t}{TELNET}} support was added.

Curl 5 was released in December 1998 and introduced the first ever curl man page. People started making Linux RPM packages out of it.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md930}{}\doxysection{1999}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md930}
January\+: DICT support added.

Open\+SSL took over and SSLeay was abandoned.

May\+: first Debian package.

August\+: LDAP\+:// and FILE\+:// support added. The curl website gets 1300 visits weekly. Moved site to curl.\+haxx.\+nu.

September\+: Released curl 6.\+0. 15000 lines of code.

December 28\+: added the project on Sourceforge and started using its services for managing the project.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md931}{}\doxysection{2000}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md931}
Spring\+: major internal overhaul to provide a suitable library interface. The first non-\/beta release was named 7.\+1 and arrived in August. This offered the easy interface and turned out to be the beginning of actually getting other software and programs to be based on and powered by libcurl. Almost 20000 lines of code.

June\+: the curl site moves to \char`\"{}curl.\+haxx.\+se\char`\"{}

August, the curl website gets 4000 visits weekly.

The PHP guys adopted libcurl already the same month, when the first ever third party libcurl binding showed up. CURL has been a supported module in PHP since the release of PHP 4.\+0.\+2. This would soon get followers. More than 16 different bindings exist at the time of this writing.

September\+: kerberos4 support was added.

November\+: started the work on a test suite for curl. It was later re-\/written from scratch again. The libcurl major SONAME number was set to 1.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md932}{}\doxysection{2001}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md932}
January\+: Daniel released curl 7.\+5.\+2 under a new license again\+: MIT (or MPL). The MIT license is extremely liberal and can be combined with GPL in other projects. This would finally put an end to the \char`\"{}complaints\char`\"{} from people involved in GPLed projects that previously were prohibited from using libcurl while it was released under MPL only. (Due to the fact that MPL is deemed \char`\"{}\+GPL incompatible\char`\"{}.)

March 22\+: curl supports \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_t_t_p}{HTTP}} 1.\+1 starting with the release of 7.\+7. This also introduced libcurl\textquotesingle{}s ability to do persistent connections. 24000 lines of code. The libcurl major SONAME number was bumped to 2 due to this overhaul. The first experimental \href{ftps://}{\texttt{ ftps\+://}} support was added.

August\+: The curl website gets 8000 visits weekly. Curl Corporation contacted Daniel to discuss \char`\"{}the name issue\char`\"{}. After Daniel\textquotesingle{}s reply, they have never since got back in touch again.

September\+: libcurl 7.\+9 introduces cookie jar and curl\+\_\+formadd(). During the forthcoming 7.\+9.\+x releases, we introduced the multi interface slowly and without many whistles.

September 25\+: curl (7.\+7.\+2) is bundled in Mac OS X (10.\+1) for the first time. It was already becoming more and more of a standard utility of Linux distributions and a regular in the BSD ports collections.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md933}{}\doxysection{2002}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md933}
June\+: the curl website gets 13000 visits weekly. curl and libcurl is 35000 lines of code. Reported successful compiles on more than 40 combinations of CPUs and operating systems.

To estimate number of users of the curl tool or libcurl library is next to impossible. Around 5000 downloaded packages each week from the main site gives a hint, but the packages are mirrored extensively, bundled with numerous OS distributions and otherwise retrieved as part of other software.

October 1\+: with the release of curl 7.\+10 it is released under the MIT license only.

Starting with 7.\+10, curl verifies SSL server certificates by default.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md934}{}\doxysection{2003}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md934}
January\+: Started working on the distributed curl tests. The autobuilds.

February\+: the curl site averages at 20000 visits weekly. At any given moment, there\textquotesingle{}s an average of 3 people browsing the website.

Multiple new authentication schemes are supported\+: Digest (May), NTLM (June) and Negotiate (June).

November\+: curl 7.\+10.\+8 is released. 45000 lines of code. $\sim$55000 unique visitors to the website. Five official web mirrors.

December\+: full-\/fledged SSL for \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_f_t_p}{FTP}} is supported.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md935}{}\doxysection{2004}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__h_i_s_t_o_r_y_autotoc_md935}
January\+: curl 7.\+11.\+0 introduced large file support.

June\+: curl 7.\+12.\+0 introduced IDN support. 10 official web mirrors.

This release bumped the major SONAME to 3 due to the removal of the curl\+\_\+formparse() function
