On Linux, install the development packages for Free\+Type, Cairo, and GLib. For example, on Ubuntu / Debian, you would do\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sudo apt-get install meson pkg-config ragel gtk-doc-tools gcc g++ libfreetype6-dev libglib2.0-dev libcairo2-dev
\end{DoxyVerb}
 whereas on Fedora, RHEL, Cent\+OS, and other Red Hat based systems you would do\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sudo dnf install meson pkgconfig gtk-doc gcc gcc-c++ freetype-devel glib2-devel cairo-dev
\end{DoxyVerb}
 and on Arch\+Linux and Manjaro\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sudo pacman -Suy meson pkg-config ragel gcc freetype2 glib2 cairo
\end{DoxyVerb}
 then use meson to build the project like {\ttfamily meson build \&\& meson test -\/Cbuild}.

On mac\+OS, {\ttfamily brew install pkg-\/config ragel gtk-\/doc freetype glib cairo meson} then use meson like above.

On Windows, meson can build the project like above if a working MSVC\textquotesingle{}s cl.\+exe ({\ttfamily vcvarsall.\+bat}) or gcc/clang is already on your path, and if you use something like {\ttfamily meson build -\/-\/wrap-\/mode=default} it fetches and compiles most of the dependencies also. It is recommended to install CMake either manually or via the Visual Studio installer when building with MSVC when building with meson.

Our CI configurations is also a good source of learning how to build Harf\+Buzz.

There is also amalgam source provided with Harf\+Buzz which reduces whole process of building Harf\+Buzz like {\ttfamily g++ src/harfbuzz.\+cc -\/fno-\/exceptions} but there is not guarantee provided with buildability and reliability of features you get.
