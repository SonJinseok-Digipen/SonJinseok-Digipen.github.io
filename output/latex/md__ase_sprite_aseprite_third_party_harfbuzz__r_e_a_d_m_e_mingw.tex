For the development of Harf\+Buzz, the Microsoft shaping technology, Uniscribe, as a widely used and tested shaper is used as more-\/or-\/less Open\+Type reference implementation and that specially is important where Open\+Type specification is or wasn\textquotesingle{}t that clear. For having access to Uniscribe on Linux/mac\+OS these steps are recommended\+:

You want to follow the 32bit instructions. The 64bit equivalents are included for reference.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Install Wine.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fedora\+: {\ttfamily dnf install wine}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Install {\ttfamily mingw-\/w64} compiler.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fedora, 32bit\+: {\ttfamily dnf install mingw32-\/gcc-\/c++}
\item Fedora, 64bit\+: {\ttfamily dnf install mingw64-\/gcc-\/c++}
\item Debian\+: {\ttfamily apt install g++-\/mingw-\/w64}
\item Mac\+: {\ttfamily brew install mingw-\/w64}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item If you have drank the {\ttfamily meson} koolaid, look at {\ttfamily .ci/build-\/win32.\+sh} to see how to invoke {\ttfamily meson} now, or just run that script. Otherwise, here\textquotesingle{}s how to use the old trusty autotools instead\+:

a) Install dependencies.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fedora, 32bit\+: {\ttfamily dnf install mingw32-\/glib2 mingw32-\/cairo mingw32-\/freetype}
\item Fedora, 64bit\+: {\ttfamily dnf install mingw64-\/glib2 mingw64-\/cairo mingw64-\/freetype}
\end{DoxyItemize}

b) Configure\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily NOCONFIGURE=1 ./autogen.sh \&\& mkdir winbuild \&\& cd winbuild}
\item 32bit\+: {\ttfamily ../mingw-\/configure.sh i686}
\item 64bit\+: {\ttfamily ../mingw-\/configure.sh x86\+\_\+64}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Now you can use {\ttfamily hb-\/shape} by {\ttfamily (cd win32build/util \&\& wine hb-\/shape.\+exe)} but if you like to shape with the Microsoft Uniscribe\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Bring a 32bit version of {\ttfamily usp10.\+dll} for yourself from {\ttfamily C\+:\textbackslash{}Windows\textbackslash{}Sys\+WOW64\textbackslash{}usp10.\+dll} of your Windows installation (assuming you have a 64-\/bit installation, otherwise {\ttfamily C\+:\textbackslash{}Windows\textbackslash{}System32\textbackslash{}usp10.\+dll}) that it is not a Direct\+Write proxy (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniscribe}{\texttt{ for more info}}). Rule of thumb, your {\ttfamily usp10.\+dll} should have a size more than 500kb, otherwise it is designed to work with Direct\+Write which Wine can\textquotesingle{}t work with its original one. You want a Uniscribe from Windows 7 or older.

Put the DLL in the folder you are going to run the next command,
\item {\ttfamily WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\char`\"{}usp10=n\char`\"{} wine hb-\/shape.\+exe fontname.\+ttf -\/u 0061,0062,0063 -\/-\/shaper=uniscribe}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

({\ttfamily 0061,0062,0063} means {\ttfamily abc}, use test/shaping/hb-\/unicode-\/decode to generate ones you need)
