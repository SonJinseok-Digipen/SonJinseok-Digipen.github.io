\item run {\ttfamily ./scripts/copyright.pl} and correct possible omissions
\item edit {\ttfamily RELEASE-\/\+NOTES} to be accurate
\item update {\ttfamily docs/\+THANKS}
\item make sure all relevant changes are committed on the master branch
\item tag the git repo in this style\+: {\ttfamily git tag -\/a curl-\/7\+\_\+34\+\_\+0}. -\/a annotates the tag and we use underscores instead of dots in the version number. Make sure the tag is GPG signed (using -\/s).
\item run \char`\"{}./maketgz 7.\+34.\+0\char`\"{} to build the release tarballs. It is important that you run this on a machine with the correct set of autotools etc installed as this is what then will be shipped and used by most users on $\ast$nix like systems.
\item push the git commits and the new tag
\item gpg sign the 4 tarballs as maketgz suggests
\item upload the 8 resulting files to the primary download directory

We do releases every 8 weeks on Wednesdays. If critical problems arise, we can insert releases outside of the schedule or we can move the release date -\/ but this is rare.

Each 8 week release cycle is split in two 4-\/week periods.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item During the first 4 weeks after a release, we allow new features and changes to curl and libcurl. If we accept any such changes, we bump the minor number used for the next release.
\item During the second 4-\/week period we do not merge any features or changes, we then only focus on fixing bugs and polishing things to make a solid coming release.
\item After a regular procedure-\/following release (made on Wednesdays), the feature window remains closed until the following Monday in case of special actions or patch releases etc.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If a future release date happens to end up on a \char`\"{}bad date\char`\"{}, like in the middle of common public holidays or when the lead release manager is away traveling, the release date can be moved forwards or backwards a full week. This is then advertised well in advance.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__r_e_l_e_a_s_e__p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e_autotoc_md1165}{}\doxysubsection{Coming dates}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs__r_e_l_e_a_s_e__p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e_autotoc_md1165}
