{\itshape laf} is a C++ library to create desktop applications for Windows, mac\+OS, and Linux. It was mainly developed for \href{https://www.aseprite.org/}{\texttt{ Aseprite}} but we want to make it available for other developers in such a way that they can create applications too.

This \char`\"{}framework\char`\"{} (or library, or set of libraries) is still under development, but we\textquotesingle{}d like to start stabilizing the main API in a near future. The objective is to create a library as small as possible, and leaving parts that are not required to be integrated, to other libraries. For example, signal and slots can be used with \href{https://github.com/NoAvailableAlias/signal-slot-benchmarks}{\texttt{ other libraries}}, or the clipboard management with \href{https://github.com/dacap/clip}{\texttt{ dacap/clip}}, etc. Even more, parts of {\itshape laf} might be separated to other libraries in the future if they are highly valuable on their own.\hypertarget{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_laf_docs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md92}{}\doxysection{Modules}\label{md__ase_sprite_aseprite_laf_docs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md92}
{\itshape laf} is a set of libraries\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[}base\mbox{]}(base)\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{class_base}{Base}} functions for any kind of application (CLI and GUI), generally one function doesn\textquotesingle{}t depend on others, so it has a minimal set of dependencies
\item \mbox{[}gfx\mbox{]}(gfx)\+: Abstract graphics classes (rectangle, point, region, etc.)
\item \mbox{[}ft\mbox{]}(ft)\+: Free\+Type wrapper used by the {\ttfamily os} module (requires {\ttfamily freetype} library as dependency). Might be deleted in the future (replaced with Skia text rendering)
\item \mbox{[}os\mbox{]}(os)\+: Functions to create windows in your Operating System
