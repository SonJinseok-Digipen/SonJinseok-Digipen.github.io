You can test shaping of a unicode sequence against a font like this\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./hb-\/unicode-\/encode\ 41\ 42\ 43\ 627\ |\ ../../util/hb-\/shape\ font.ttf}

\end{DoxyCode}
 assuming an in-\/tree build. The 41 42 43 627 here is a sequence of Unicode codepoints\+: U+0041,0042,0043,0627. When you are happy with the shape results, you can use the {\ttfamily record-\/test.\+sh} script to add this to the test suite. {\ttfamily record-\/test.\+sh} requires {\ttfamily pyftsubset} to be installed. You can get {\ttfamily pyftsubset} by installing Font\+Tools from \href{https://github.com/behdad/fonttools}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/behdad/fonttools}}.

To use {\ttfamily record-\/test.\+sh}, just put it right before the {\ttfamily hb-\/shape} invocation\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./hb-\/unicode-\/encode\ 41\ 42\ 43\ 627\ |\ ./record-\/test.sh\ ../../util/hb-\/shape\ font.ttf}

\end{DoxyCode}
 what this does is\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Subset the font for the sequence of Unicode characters requested,
\item Compare the {\ttfamily hb-\/shape} output of the original font versus the subset font for the input sequence,
\item If the outputs differ, perhaps it is because the font does not have glyph names; it then compares the output of {\ttfamily hb-\/view} for both fonts.
\item If the outputs differ, recording fails. Otherwise, it will move the subset font file into {\ttfamily data/in-\/house/fonts} and name it after its hash, and print out the test case input, which you can then redirect to an existing or new test file in {\ttfamily data/in-\/house/tests} using {\ttfamily -\/o}, e.\+g.\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./hb-\/unicode-\/encode\ 41\ 42\ 43\ 627\ |\ ./record-\/test.sh\ -\/o\ data/in-\/house/tests/test-\/name.test\ ../../util/hb-\/shape\ font.ttf}

\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyItemize}

If you created a new test file, add it to {\ttfamily data/in-\/house/\+Makefile.\+sources} so it is run. Check that {\ttfamily make check} does indeed run it, and that the test passes. When everything looks good, {\ttfamily git add} the new font as well as the new test file if you created any. You can see what new files are there by running {\ttfamily git status data/in-\/house}. And commit!
