\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Open gitk and review changes since last release.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Print all public API changes\+: `git diff \$(git describe $\vert$ sed \textquotesingle{}s/-\/.$\ast$//').. src/$\ast$.h\`{}
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Document them in NEWS. All API and API semantic changes should be clearly marked as API additions, API changes, or API deletions.
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Document deprecations. Ensure all new API / deprecations are in listed correctly in docs/harfbuzz-\/sections.\+txt. If release added new API, add entry for new API index at the end of docs/harfbuzz-\/docs.\+xml.

If there\textquotesingle{}s a backward-\/incompatible API change (including deletions for API used anywhere), that\textquotesingle{}s a release blocker. Do NOT release.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Based on severity of changes, decide whether it\textquotesingle{}s a minor or micro release number bump.
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Search for REPLACEME on the repository and replace it with the chosen version for the release.
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Make sure you have correct date and new version at the top of NEWS file.
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Bump version in line 3 of meson.\+build and configure.\+ac.
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Do a {\ttfamily meson test -\/Cbuild} so it both checks the tests and updates \mbox{\hyperlink{hb-version_8h_source}{hb-\/version.\+h}} (use {\ttfamily git diff} to see if is really updated).
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Commit NEWS, meson.\+build, configure.\+ac, and \mbox{\hyperlink{hb-version_8h_source}{src/hb-\/version.\+h}}, as well as any REPLACEME changes you made. The commit message is simply the release number, e. g. \char`\"{}1.\+4.\+7\char`\"{}
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Do a {\ttfamily meson dist -\/Cbuild} that runs the tests against the latest committed changes. If doesn\textquotesingle{}t pass, something fishy is going on, reset the repo and start over.
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Tag the release and sign it\+: e.\+g. {\ttfamily git tag -\/s 1.\+4.\+7 -\/m 1.\+4.\+7}. Enter your GPG password.
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Push the commit and tag out\+: {\ttfamily git push -\/-\/follow-\/tags}.
