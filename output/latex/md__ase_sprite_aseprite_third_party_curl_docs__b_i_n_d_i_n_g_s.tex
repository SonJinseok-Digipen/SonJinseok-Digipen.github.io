Creative people have written bindings or interfaces for various environments and programming languages. Using one of these allows you to take advantage of curl powers from within your favourite language or system.

This is a list of all known interfaces as of this writing.

The bindings listed below are not part of the curl/libcurl distribution archives, but must be downloaded and installed separately.
