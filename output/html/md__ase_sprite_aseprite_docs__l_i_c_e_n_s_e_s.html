&lt;a href="http://liballeg.org/" &gt;Allegro 4&lt;/a&gt;</h1>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">Allegro is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in</div>
<div class="line">cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift. You may use,</div>
<div class="line">modify, redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like,</div>
<div class="line">and you do not have to give us anything in return.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">However, if you like this product you are encouraged to thank us by</div>
<div class="line">making a return gift to the Allegro community. This could be by</div>
<div class="line">writing an add-on package, providing a useful bug report, making an</div>
<div class="line">improvement to the library, or perhaps just releasing the sources of</div>
<div class="line">your program so that other people can learn from them. If you</div>
<div class="line">redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, it would be</div>
<div class="line">nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you are</div>
<div class="line">not required to do this. We trust you not to abuse our generosity.</div>

<div class="line">  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG</div>

<div class="line">  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    o We don&#39;t promise that this software works. However, we will be</div>
<div class="line">      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is&#39; distribution)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or</div>
<div class="line">      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free&#39; usage)</div>

<div class="line">ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,</div>
<div class="line">sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.</div>
<div class="line">ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead</div>
<div class="line">by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,</div>
<div class="line">that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file</div>
<div class="line">ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part</div>
<div class="line">of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than</div>
<div class="line">the foregoing paragraphs do.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was produced with GNU Autoconf.</div>
<div class="line">It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.</div>
<div class="line">The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,</div>
<div class="line">ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright</div>
<div class="line">by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by</div>
<div class="line">patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot</div>
<div class="line">legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,</div>
<div class="line">support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.</div>
<div class="line">(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented</div>
<div class="line">Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)</div>
<div class="line">So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining</div>
<div class="line">code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.</div>
<div class="line">To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has</div>
<div class="line">been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce</div>
<div class="line">&quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;.  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the</div>
<div class="line">resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard</div>
<div class="line">GIF decoders.</div>
