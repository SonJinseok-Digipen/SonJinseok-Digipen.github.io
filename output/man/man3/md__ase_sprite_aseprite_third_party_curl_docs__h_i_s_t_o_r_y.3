.PP
Towards the end of 1996, Daniel Stenberg was spending time writing an IRC bot for an Amiga related channel on EFnet\&. He then came up with the idea to make currency-exchange calculations available to Internet Relay Chat (IRC) users\&. All the necessary data were published on the Web; he just needed to automate their retrieval\&.
.SH "1996"
.PP
On November 11, 1996 the Brazilian developer Rafael Sagula wrote and released HttpGet version 0\&.1\&.
.PP
Daniel extended this existing command-line open-source tool\&. After a few minor adjustments, it did just what he needed\&. The first release with Daniel's additions was 0\&.2, released on December 17, 1996\&. Daniel quickly became the new maintainer of the project\&.
.SH "1997"
.PP
HttpGet 0\&.3 was released in January 1997 and now it accepted \fBHTTP\fP URLs on the command line\&.
.PP
HttpGet 1\&.0 was released on April 8th 1997 with brand new \fBHTTP\fP proxy support\&.
.PP
We soon found and fixed support for getting currencies over GOPHER\&. Once \fBFTP\fP download support was added, the name of the project was changed and urlget 2\&.0 was released in August 1997\&. The http-only days were already passed\&.
.PP
Version 2\&.2 was released on August 14 1997 and introduced support to build for and run on Windows and Solaris\&.
.PP
November 24 1997: Version 3\&.1 added \fBFTP\fP upload support\&.
.PP
Version 3\&.5 added support for \fBHTTP\fP POST\&.
.SH "1998"
.PP
February 4: urlget 3\&.10
.PP
February 9: urlget 3\&.11
.PP
March 14: urlget 3\&.12 added proxy authentication\&.
.PP
The project slowly grew bigger\&. With upload capabilities, the name was once again misleading and a second name change was made\&. On March 20, 1998 curl 4 was released\&. (The version numbering from the previous names was kept\&.)
.PP
(Unrelated to this project a company called Curl Corporation registered a US trademark on the name 'CURL' on May 18 1998\&. That company had then already registered the curl\&.com domain back in November of the previous year\&. All this was revealed to us much later\&.)
.PP
SSL support was added, powered by the SSLeay library\&.
.PP
August: first announcement of curl on freshmeat\&.net\&.
.PP
October: with the curl 4\&.9 release and the introduction of cookie support, curl was no longer released under the GPL license\&. Now we're at 4000 lines of code, we switched over to the MPL license to restrict the effects of 'copyleft'\&.
.PP
November: configure script and reported successful compiles on several major operating systems\&. The never-quite-understood -F option was added and curl could now simulate quite a lot of a browser\&. \fBTELNET\fP support was added\&.
.PP
Curl 5 was released in December 1998 and introduced the first ever curl man page\&. People started making Linux RPM packages out of it\&.
.SH "1999"
.PP
January: DICT support added\&.
.PP
OpenSSL took over and SSLeay was abandoned\&.
.PP
May: first Debian package\&.
.PP
August: LDAP:// and FILE:// support added\&. The curl website gets 1300 visits weekly\&. Moved site to curl\&.haxx\&.nu\&.
.PP
September: Released curl 6\&.0\&. 15000 lines of code\&.
.PP
December 28: added the project on Sourceforge and started using its services for managing the project\&.
.SH "2000"
.PP
Spring: major internal overhaul to provide a suitable library interface\&. The first non-beta release was named 7\&.1 and arrived in August\&. This offered the easy interface and turned out to be the beginning of actually getting other software and programs to be based on and powered by libcurl\&. Almost 20000 lines of code\&.
.PP
June: the curl site moves to 'curl\&.haxx\&.se'
.PP
August, the curl website gets 4000 visits weekly\&.
.PP
The PHP guys adopted libcurl already the same month, when the first ever third party libcurl binding showed up\&. CURL has been a supported module in PHP since the release of PHP 4\&.0\&.2\&. This would soon get followers\&. More than 16 different bindings exist at the time of this writing\&.
.PP
September: kerberos4 support was added\&.
.PP
November: started the work on a test suite for curl\&. It was later re-written from scratch again\&. The libcurl major SONAME number was set to 1\&.
.SH "2001"
.PP
January: Daniel released curl 7\&.5\&.2 under a new license again: MIT (or MPL)\&. The MIT license is extremely liberal and can be combined with GPL in other projects\&. This would finally put an end to the 'complaints' from people involved in GPLed projects that previously were prohibited from using libcurl while it was released under MPL only\&. (Due to the fact that MPL is deemed 'GPL incompatible'\&.)
.PP
March 22: curl supports \fBHTTP\fP 1\&.1 starting with the release of 7\&.7\&. This also introduced libcurl's ability to do persistent connections\&. 24000 lines of code\&. The libcurl major SONAME number was bumped to 2 due to this overhaul\&. The first experimental ftps:// support was added\&.
.PP
August: The curl website gets 8000 visits weekly\&. Curl Corporation contacted Daniel to discuss 'the name issue'\&. After Daniel's reply, they have never since got back in touch again\&.
.PP
September: libcurl 7\&.9 introduces cookie jar and curl_formadd()\&. During the forthcoming 7\&.9\&.x releases, we introduced the multi interface slowly and without many whistles\&.
.PP
September 25: curl (7\&.7\&.2) is bundled in Mac OS X (10\&.1) for the first time\&. It was already becoming more and more of a standard utility of Linux distributions and a regular in the BSD ports collections\&.
.SH "2002"
.PP
June: the curl website gets 13000 visits weekly\&. curl and libcurl is 35000 lines of code\&. Reported successful compiles on more than 40 combinations of CPUs and operating systems\&.
.PP
To estimate number of users of the curl tool or libcurl library is next to impossible\&. Around 5000 downloaded packages each week from the main site gives a hint, but the packages are mirrored extensively, bundled with numerous OS distributions and otherwise retrieved as part of other software\&.
.PP
October 1: with the release of curl 7\&.10 it is released under the MIT license only\&.
.PP
Starting with 7\&.10, curl verifies SSL server certificates by default\&.
.SH "2003"
.PP
January: Started working on the distributed curl tests\&. The autobuilds\&.
.PP
February: the curl site averages at 20000 visits weekly\&. At any given moment, there's an average of 3 people browsing the website\&.
.PP
Multiple new authentication schemes are supported: Digest (May), NTLM (June) and Negotiate (June)\&.
.PP
November: curl 7\&.10\&.8 is released\&. 45000 lines of code\&. ~55000 unique visitors to the website\&. Five official web mirrors\&.
.PP
December: full-fledged SSL for \fBFTP\fP is supported\&.
.SH "2004"
.PP
January: curl 7\&.11\&.0 introduced large file support\&.
.PP
