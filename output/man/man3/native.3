.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Functions related to accessing native handles\&. 

\fBBy using the native access functions you assert that you know what you're doing and how to fix problems caused by using them\&. If you don't, you shouldn't be using them\&.\fP
.PP
Before the inclusion of \fBglfw3native\&.h\fP, you may define zero or more window system API macro and zero or more context creation API macros\&.
.PP
The chosen backends must match those the library was compiled for\&. Failure to do this will cause a link-time error\&.
.PP
The available window API macros are:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_WIN32\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_COCOA\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_X11\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_WAYLAND\fP
.PP
.PP
The available context API macros are:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_WGL\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_NSGL\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_GLX\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_EGL\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_OSMESA\fP
.PP
.PP
These macros select which of the native access functions that are declared and which platform-specific headers to include\&. It is then up your (by definition platform-specific) code to handle which of these should be defined\&.
.PP
If you do not want the platform-specific headers to be included, define \fCGLFW_NATIVE_INCLUDE_NONE\fP before including the \fBglfw3native\&.h\fP header\&.
