.PP
Here are some benchmarks, run on a 2\&.3GHz 8-core i9 macbook pro\&. The input text is a 1106 KB Markdown file built by concatenating the Markdown sources of all the localizations of the first edition of \fC\fIPro Git\fP\fP by Scott Chacon\&.

Implementation   Time (sec)    \fBcommonmark\&.js\fP   0\&.59    \fBcmark\fP   0\&.12    \fBmd4c\fP   0\&.04   
.PP
To run these benchmarks, use \fCmake bench PROG=/path/to/program\fP\&.
.PP
\fCtime\fP is used to measure execution speed\&. The reported time is the \fIdifference\fP between the time to run the program with the benchmark input and the time to run it with no input\&. (This procedure ensures that implementations in dynamic languages are not penalized by startup time\&.) \fBA\fP median of ten runs is taken\&. The process is reniced to a high priority so that the system doesn't interrupt runs\&.
