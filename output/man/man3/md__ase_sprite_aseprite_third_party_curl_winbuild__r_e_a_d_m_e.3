.SH NAME
md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_winbuild__r_e_a_d_m_e \- Building curl with Visual C++ 
.PP
This document describes how to compile, build and install curl and libcurl from sources using the Visual C++ build tool\&. To build with VC++, you will of course have to first install VC++\&. The minimum required version of VC is 6 (part of Visual Studio 6)\&. However using a more recent version is strongly recommended\&.
.PP
VC++ is also part of the Windows Platform SDK\&. You do not have to install the full Visual Studio or Visual C++ if all you want is to build curl\&.
.PP
The latest Platform SDK can be downloaded freely from [Windows SDK and emulator archive](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive)
.SH "Prerequisites"
.PP
If you wish to support zlib, openssl, c-ares, ssh2, you will have to download them separately and copy them to the deps directory as shown below:
.PP
somedirectory\\ |_curl-src | |_winbuild | |_deps |_ lib |_ include |_ bin
.PP
It is also possible to create the deps directory in some other random places and tell the Makefile its location using the WITH_DEVEL option\&.
.SH "Building straight from git"
.PP
When you check out code git and build it, as opposed from a released source code archive, you need to first run the \fCbuildconf\&.bat\fP batch file (present in the source code root directory) to set things up\&.
.SH "Open a command prompt"
.PP
Open a Visual Studio Command prompt:
.PP
Using the **'Developer Command Prompt for VS [version]'** menu entry: where [version} is the Visual Studio version\&. The developer prompt at default uses the x86 mode\&. It is required to call \fCVcvarsall\&.bat\fP to setup the prompt for the machine type you want\&. This type of command prompt may not exist in all Visual Studio versions\&.
.PP
See also: \fCDeveloper Command Prompt for Visual Studio\fP and \fCHow to: Enable a 64-Bit, x64 hosted MSVC toolset on the command line\fP
.PP
Using the **'VS [version] [platform] [type] Command Prompt'** menu entry: where [version] is the Visual Studio version, [platform] is e\&.g\&. x64 and [type] Native of Cross platform build\&. This type of command prompt may not exist in all Visual Studio versions\&.
.PP

.SH "Build in the console"
.PP
Once you are in the console, go to the winbuild directory in the Curl sources:
.PP
cd curl-src\\winbuild
.PP
Then you can call \fCnmake /f Makefile\&.vc\fP with the desired options (see below)\&. The builds will be in the top src directory, \fCbuilds\\\fP directory, in a directory named using the options given to the nmake call\&.
.PP
nmake /f Makefile\&.vc mode=<static or dll> <options>
.PP

.SH "Static linking of Microsoft's C RunTime (CRT):"
.PP
If you are using mode=static nmake will create and link to the static build of libcurl but \fInot\fP the static CRT\&. If you must you can force nmake to link in the static CRT by passing RTLIBCFG=static\&. Typically you shouldn't use that option, and nmake will default to the DLL CRT\&. RTLIBCFG is rarely used and therefore rarely tested\&. When passing RTLIBCFG for a configuration that was already built but not with that option, or if the option was specified differently, you must destroy the build directory containing the configuration so that nmake can build it from scratch\&.
.SH "Building your own application with a static libcurl"
.PP
When building an application that uses the static libcurl library on Windows, you must define CURL_STATICLIB\&. Otherwise the linker will look for dynamic import symbols\&.
.SH "Legacy Windows and SSL"
.PP
When you build curl using the build files in this directory the default SSL backend will be Schannel (Windows SSPI), the native SSL library that comes with the Windows OS\&. Schannel in Windows <= XP is not able to connect to servers that no longer support the legacy handshakes and algorithms used by those versions\&. If you will be using curl in one of those earlier versions of Windows you should choose another SSL backend like OpenSSL\&.
