.PP 
Structure that represents a haptic direction\&. 

This is the direction where the force comes from, instead of the direction in which the force is exerted\&.
.PP
Directions can be specified by:
.IP "\(bu" 2
SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR : Specified by polar coordinates\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN : Specified by cartesian coordinates\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL : Specified by spherical coordinates\&.
.PP
.PP
Cardinal directions of the haptic device are relative to the positioning of the device\&. North is considered to be away from the user\&.
.PP
The following diagram represents the cardinal directions:

If type is SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR, direction is encoded by hundredths of a degree starting north and turning clockwise\&. SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR only uses the first \fCdir\fP parameter\&. The cardinal directions would be:
.IP "\(bu" 2
North: 0 (0 degrees)
.IP "\(bu" 2
East: 9000 (90 degrees)
.IP "\(bu" 2
South: 18000 (180 degrees)
.IP "\(bu" 2
West: 27000 (270 degrees)
.PP
.PP
If type is SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN, direction is encoded by three positions (X axis, Y axis and Z axis (with 3 axes))\&. SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN uses the first three \fCdir\fP parameters\&. The cardinal directions would be:
.IP "\(bu" 2
North: 0,-1, 0
.IP "\(bu" 2
East: 1, 0, 0
.IP "\(bu" 2
South: 0, 1, 0
.IP "\(bu" 2
West: -1, 0, 0
.PP
.PP
The Z axis represents the height of the effect if supported, otherwise it's unused\&. In cartesian encoding (1, 2) would be the same as (2, 4), you can use any multiple you want, only the direction matters\&.
.PP
If type is SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL, direction is encoded by two rotations\&. The first two \fCdir\fP parameters are used\&. The \fCdir\fP parameters are as follows (all values are in hundredths of degrees):
.IP "\(bu" 2
Degrees from (1, 0) rotated towards (0, 1)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Degrees towards (0, 0, 1) (device needs at least 3 axes)\&.
.PP
.PP
Example of force coming from the south with all encodings (force coming from the south means the user will have to pull the stick to counteract): 
.PP
.nf
SDL_HapticDirection direction;

// Cartesian directions
direction\&.type = SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN; // Using cartesian direction encoding\&.
direction\&.dir[0] = 0; // X position
direction\&.dir[1] = 1; // Y position
// Assuming the device has 2 axes, we don't need to specify third parameter\&.

// Polar directions
direction\&.type = SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR; // We'll be using polar direction encoding\&.
direction\&.dir[0] = 18000; // Polar only uses first parameter

// Spherical coordinates
direction\&.type = SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL; // Spherical encoding
direction\&.dir[0] = 9000; // Since we only have two axes we don't need more parameters\&.
