md__ase_sprite_aseprite_third_party_curl_docs_examples__r_e_a_d_m_e \- libcurl examples 
.PP
This directory is for libcurl programming examples\&. They are meant to show some simple steps on how you can build your own application to take full advantage of libcurl\&.
.PP
If you end up with other small but still useful example sources, please mail them for submission in future packages and on the website\&.
.SH "Building"
.PP
The Makefile\&.example is an example makefile that could be used to build these examples\&. Just edit the file according to your system and requirements first\&.
.PP
Most examples should build fine using a command line like this: 
.PP
.nf
`curl-config --cc --cflags --libs` -o example example\&.c

.fi
.PP
 Some compilers don't like having the arguments in this order but instead want you do reorganize them like: 
.PP
.nf
`curl-config --cc` -o example example\&.c `curl-config --cflags --libs`

.fi
.PP
 \fBPlease\fP do not use the \fCcurl\&.se\fP site as a test target for your libcurl applications/experiments\&. Even if some of the examples use that site as a URL at some places, it doesn't mean that the URLs work or that we expect you to actually torture our website with your tests! Thanks\&.
.SH "Examples"
.PP
Each example source code file is designed to be and work stand-alone and rather self-explanatory\&. The examples may at times lack the level of error checks you need in a real world, but that is then only for the sake of readability: to make the code smaller and easier to follow\&.
