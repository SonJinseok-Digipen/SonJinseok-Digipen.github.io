IXWebSocket is a C++ library for WebSocket client and server development\&. It has minimal dependencies (no boost), is very simple to use and support everything you'll likely need for websocket dev (SSL, deflate compression, compiles on most platforms, etc\&.\&.\&.)\&. \fBHTTP\fP client and server code is also available, but it hasn't received as much testing\&.
.PP
It is been used on big mobile video game titles sending and receiving tons of messages since 2017 (iOS and Android)\&. It was tested on macOS, iOS, Linux, Android, Windows and FreeBSD\&. Two important design goals are simplicity and correctness\&.

Interested? Go read the \fCdocs\fP! If things don't work as expected, please create an issue on GitHub, or even better a pull request if you know how to fix your problem\&.

IXWebSocket is actively being developed, check out the \fCchangelog\fP to know what's cooking\&. If you are looking for a real time messaging service (the chat-like 'server' your websocket code will talk to) with many features such as history, backed by Redis, look at \fCcobra\fP\&.
.PP
IXWebSocket client code is autobahn compliant beginning with the 6\&.0\&.0 version\&. See the current \fCtest results\fP\&. Some tests are still failing in the server code\&.
.PP
Starting with the 11\&.0\&.8 release, IXWebSocket should be fully C++11 compatible\&.

\fCuvweb\fP is a library written by the IXWebSocket author which is built on top of \fCuvw\fP, which is a C++ wrapper for \fClibuv\fP\&. It has more dependencies and does not support SSL at this point, but it can be used to open multiple connections within a single OS thread thanks to libuv\&.
